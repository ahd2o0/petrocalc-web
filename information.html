        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">What is Petroleum Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas. This includes the exploration, drilling, production, and refining processes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Identifying potential reservoirs.</li>
                <li><strong>Drilling:</strong> Creating wells to access hydrocarbons.</li>
                <li><strong>Production:</strong> Extracting oil and gas from the reservoir.</li>
                <li><strong>Reservoir Engineering:</strong> Managing the reservoir to maximize recovery.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Types of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs</h2>
            <p>Hydrocarbon reservoirs are underground accumulations of permeable and porous rock that contain oil or natural gas. They are typically classified by the type of fluid they contain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil Reservoirs:</strong> Primarily contain crude oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Reservoirs:</strong> Primarily contain natural gas.</li>
                <li><strong>Condensate Reservoirs:</strong> Contain gas that condenses into liquid hydrocarbons at surface conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Underground Water Reservoirs:</strong> Often associated with hydrocarbon reservoirs, providing natural drive mechanisms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding the characteristics of these reservoirs is crucial for efficient extraction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Key Properties of Reservoir Rocks</h2>
            <p>The ability of a reservoir rock to store and transmit fluids is determined by its properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Porosity (Φ):</strong> The percentage of total rock volume that is pore space. It represents the storage capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Permeability (k):</strong> A measure of the ability of a rock to transmit fluids. High permeability allows fluids to flow easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Saturation (S):</strong> The fraction of the pore volume occupied by a particular fluid (e.g., water, oil, gas).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Role of Formation Volume Factor (FVF)</h2>
            <p>Formation Volume Factor (FVF) is a crucial parameter in reservoir engineering. It represents the ratio of the volume of oil, gas, or water at reservoir conditions to the volume of the same fluid at standard surface conditions (STB, SCF, or barrels).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Oil FVF (Bo):</strong> Converts reservoir barrels to stock tank barrels.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas FVF (Bg):</strong> Converts reservoir cubic feet to standard cubic feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Water FVF (Bw):</strong> Converts reservoir barrels of water to standard barrels of water.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>FVF helps in calculating reserves and production rates accurately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Formation</h2>
            <p>In petroleum engineering, a "formation" refers to a distinct body of rock with specific characteristics, usually defined by its lithology (rock type), age, and physical properties. Understanding formations is crucial for identifying and exploiting hydrocarbon reservoirs.</p>
            <h3>Types of Sedimentary Formations (Relevant to Oil & Gas)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sandstone:</strong> Formed from cemented sand grains. Known for good porosity and permeability, making them excellent reservoir rocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Limestone & Dolomite (Carbonates):</strong> Formed from the accumulation of marine organisms. Porosity and permeability can vary widely due to fracturing, dissolution, or crystallization.</li>
                <li><strong>Shale:</strong> Fine-grained sedimentary rock, often acting as a seal (cap rock) above reservoirs due to its low permeability. Can also be a source rock for hydrocarbons.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaporites:</strong> Formed from the evaporation of water (e.g., salt, gypsum). Often act as effective seals due to their impermeability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Aspects of Formation Evaluation</h3>
            <p>Geologists and engineers evaluate formations to determine their potential for hydrocarbon accumulation. This involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Using wireline or LWD (Logging While Drilling) tools to measure physical properties downhole (e.g., resistivity, density, gamma ray).</li>
                <li><strong>Coring:</strong> Extracting rock samples (cores) from the wellbore for detailed laboratory analysis of porosity, permeability, and fluid saturation.</li>
                <li><strong>Seismic Surveys:</strong> Using sound waves to create images of subsurface rock layers and identify potential traps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Accurate formation evaluation helps in deciding where to drill, how to complete a well, and how to manage reservoir production.</p>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Reservoir Fluids</h2>
            <p>Hydrocarbon reservoirs typically contain a mixture of oil, gas, and water. Understanding the properties and behavior of these fluids under reservoir conditions is vital for efficient production.</p>
            <h3>Crude Oil</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Complex mixture of hydrocarbons (paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, asphaltenes) with varying molecular weights.</li>
                <li><strong>Density & API Gravity:</strong> API Gravity is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water. Higher API gravity means lighter oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Viscosity:</strong> A measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. Lower viscosity means easier flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Natural Gas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Primarily methane (CH₄), but can contain other hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, butane) and non-hydrocarbons (CO₂, N₂, H₂S).</li>
                <li><strong>Dry Gas vs. Wet Gas:</strong> Dry gas is almost pure methane. Wet gas contains heavier hydrocarbons that can be condensed into liquids at surface conditions (condensate).</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Compressibility Factor (Z-factor):</strong> Accounts for the deviation of real gas behavior from ideal gas law.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Formation Water</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Naturally occurring water found in porous and permeable rock formations. It contains dissolved salts and minerals.</li>
                <li><strong>Salinity:</strong> A measure of the total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water. High salinity can cause corrosion and scaling issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Formation water is often mobile within the reservoir and can provide natural water drive, or it can be injected for secondary recovery.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Well Logging Basics</h2>
            <p>Well logging involves lowering measuring instruments (sondes) into the wellbore to acquire continuous measurements of various physical properties of the formations and fluids encountered. These logs provide crucial data for reservoir characterization and well completion decisions.</p>
            <h3>Common Types of Logs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gamma Ray (GR) Log:</strong> Measures natural radioactivity. High readings often indicate shale (non-reservoir rock), while low readings suggest sandstones or carbonates (potential reservoir rock).</li>
                <li><strong>Resistivity Log:</strong> Measures the electrical resistance of the formation. Hydrocarbons and gas are resistive, while formation water is conductive (low resistivity). Used to identify hydrocarbon zones and estimate water saturation.</li>
                <li><strong>Porosity Logs (Density, Neutron, Sonic):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Density Log:</strong> Measures formation bulk density, used to estimate porosity and lithology.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neutron Log:</strong> Measures hydrogen content, which is inversely related to porosity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sonic Log:</strong> Measures the travel time of sound waves through the formation, also used to estimate porosity and identify lithology.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Spontaneous Potential (SP) Log:</strong> Measures natural voltage differences between the drilling mud and formation water. Used to identify permeable beds (sand) and estimate shale content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications of Well Logs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying hydrocarbon-bearing zones.</li>
                <li>Estimating reservoir properties (porosity, water saturation, permeability).</li>
                <li>Determining lithology (rock type).</li>
                <li>Correlating formations between wells.</li>
                <li>Planning well completion strategies.</li>
            </ul>
