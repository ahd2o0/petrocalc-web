            <h3>1. Petroleum Formation:</h3>
            <p>Oil and natural gas are formed from the remains of microscopic marine organisms (plankton) and plants that lived millions of years ago. After their death, these remains settled on seabeds, mixing with sediments. Over time, due to high pressure and temperature beneath the Earth's surface, these organic materials transformed into hydrocarbons (oil and gas).</p>

            <h3>2. Exploration Methods:</h3>
            <p>Exploration methods include surface geology, seismic surveys (using sound waves to identify subsurface rock structures), geophysical surveys (such as gravity and magnetic), and exploratory drilling to confirm the presence of hydrocarbons.</p>

            <h3>3. Overview of Drilling Operations:</h3>
            <p>Drilling operations involve using large drilling rigs to create a wellbore that reaches oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling mud is used to cool the drill bit, transport cuttings to the surface, and control reservoir pressure. After drilling, casing strings are run and cemented in place.</p>

            <h3>4. Production Stages:</h3>
            <p>After a well is drilled, the production phase begins. Wellhead equipment (Christmas tree) is installed on the surface. Oil and gas flow to the surface due to natural reservoir pressure (primary recovery), then enhanced methods like water or gas injection (secondary recovery) are used to maintain pressure, and finally, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques are applied to increase production.</p>

            <h3>5. Refining Basics:</h3>
            <p>Crude oil extracted cannot be used directly. It is sent to oil refineries where it is separated into different products such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and heavy oils through distillation and other processes like cracking and hydrotreating.</p>

            <h3>6. Environmental Considerations:</h3>
            <p>The oil and gas industry is increasingly focusing on environmental sustainability. Efforts include reducing carbon emissions, waste management, protecting biodiversity, and utilizing Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies to mitigate environmental impacts.</p>

            <h3>7. Global Importance of Oil and Gas:</h3>
            <p>Oil and gas remain major global energy sources and are essential for manufacturing many basic products such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizers. They play a vital role in the global economy and international politics.</p>
